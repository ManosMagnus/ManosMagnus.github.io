For the next few days it's community bonding period. I  will take advantage of
this time to let the community know about my project and it's goals, as well as
get a head start on the coding period. 

Firstly, I invited in the weekly-meetings of ZAP's core team. As my mentors
inform me the team is working on ZAP 2.8.0 release which is going to be released
at the following... <period-of-time>. 

In reference to my project, until Friday I will publish a new post about
WebSocket Passive Scanning. I am planning for the next few days sum up the work
I have done before and organize my workflow and timeline. First of all, I am
going to focus on [[https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/pull/1718][PR#1718]] which, from my prospective, is close to get merged.

*Happy Coding, Happy (GSoC) Summer!*
